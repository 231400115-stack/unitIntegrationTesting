## Lab Title
Unit Testing and Integration Testing using PyTest and GitHub Actions

## Project Description
This project is developed to understand and implement Unit Testing and Integration
Testing concepts using PyTest. A simple banking application is created in Python,
and different test cases are written to verify the correctness of individual functions
as well as the interaction between multiple functions.

Unit testing ensures that each function works correctly in isolation, while
integration testing verifies that multiple modules work together properly.
GitHub Actions is used to automate test execution through Continuous Integration (CI).

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- PyTest
- PyTest-HTML
- GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- VS Code
